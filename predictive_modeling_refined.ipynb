Features with 1 or more than 2 categories are<br>  left intact.<br>- array : ``drop[i]`` is the category in feature ``X[:, i]`` that<br>  should be dropped.<br><br>When `max_categories` or `min_frequency` is configured to group<br>infrequent categories, the dropping behavior is handled after the<br>grouping.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.21<br>   The parameter `drop` was added in 0.21.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 0.23<br>   The option `drop='if_binary'` was added in 0.23.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 1.1<br>    Support for dropping infrequent categories.</span>\n",

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

    "Model performance remained stable after feature reduction and removal of survey weights. Across Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models, ROC-AUC values remained consistently high (≈0.94–0.95), indicating strong discriminative ability. The reduced feature set ( form 40 to 19) preserved nearly all predictive signal while improving interpretability and reducing redundancy. Ensemble tree-based models continued to outperform linear models, with Gradient Boosting achieving the best balance between precision and recall, and XGBoost yielding the highest ROC-AUC. These results demonstrate that a compact set of core demographic, employment, household, and financial variables is sufficient to accurately predict income category.\n",

We performed a stratified 80/20 train-test split and evaluated models using ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1 due to class imbalance. Results remained stable after reducing the feature set, indicating most predictive signal is captured by core demographic, employment, household, and investment-related variables."
